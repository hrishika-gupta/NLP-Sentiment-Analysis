# üõí NLP Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling on BigBasket App Reviews

A full-stack NLP project built to analyze customer reviews of the BigBasket Android app. This project applies a range of machine learning and lexicon-based techniques to extract sentiment, identify dominant emotions, and uncover hidden topics from unstructured user feedback.

> üìç Built as an end-term academic project for NLP coursework.

## üîç Problem Statement

BigBasket, one of India‚Äôs leading grocery delivery platforms, receives thousands of reviews on its mobile app. These reviews contain valuable feedback about product quality, delivery speed, app experience, and customer service. However, being unstructured text, this information remains largely underutilized.

This project answers:
- What are the most common sentiments expressed in reviews?
- What emotions drive positive or negative feedback?
- What topics do customers care most about?
- How accurately can we classify user sentiment using machine learning?
